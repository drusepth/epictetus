If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.
Only the educated are free.
You are a little soul carrying around a corpse.
Do not try to seem wise to others.
If you would be a reader, read; if a writer, write.
Demand not that things happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do, and you will go on well.
